A comprehensive research repository for the Eholoko Fluxon Model, a theory of cosmology and physics that proposes a eholokon (solitonic) foundation for understanding the fundamental nature of reality.

## Overview

The Eholoko (Oshiwambo meaning 'appearance') Fluxon Model (EFM) attempts at a paradigm shift in theoretical physics, proposing that all physical phenomena emerge from the interactions of scalar motion as initially proposed by Dewey B. Larson's Reciprocal System Theory. We further posit that the scalar motions are 'self interactions' of an underlying energy field termed the 'Ehokolo Fluxon Field' (φ phi) which organizes into 8 distinct harmonically quantized energy levels or 'densities' which are configurations of the reciprocity principle:

 x· t= k
 
Furthermore, these densities interact in a reciprocal and geometrical manner to form stable Eholokon (solitonic) entities. The dynamic properties and behaviour of Eholoko can be described by the non-linear Klein-Gordon equation:

∂²φ/∂t² - c²∇²φ + m²φ + gφ³ + ηφ⁵ + αφ(∂φ/∂t)∇φ + δ(∂φ/∂t)²φ + γφ – βcos(ωnt)φ = 8πGkφ²

Where the terms represent:
+ ∂²φ/∂t² - c²∇²φ: These are the standard linear wave terms, describing the propagation of disturbances in the φ field.
+ m²φ: A mass-like term that provides confinement, allowing stable, localized ehokolon (soliton) structures to form.
+ gφ³ + ηφ⁵: These are non-linear self-interaction terms. They are crucial for modeling complex interactions, the stability of ehokolons, and the emergence of forces between them.
+ = 8πGkφ²: The emergent gravity term. The energy of the field itself (proportional to kφ²) acts as the source for its own gravitational potential, replacing the spacetime curvature of General Relativity.

### Density-Dependent Physics

A core principle of the EFM is that the laws of physics are not universal constants but are (density)state-dependent. The parameters (or "coupling constants") m, g, η, α, δ, γ, β, ωn are not arbitrary but take on specific values depending on the Harmonic Density State (S/T(N1), T/S(N2), S=T(N3) etc..) being simulated. For instance:

The State Parameter (α) tunes the system for different dynamics, such as the large-scale interactions of cosmology versus the relativistic effects of particle physics.

The Harmonic Driving Term (– βcos(ωnt)φ) represents the influence of the universe's underlying quantized frequency (ωn), which changes depending on the density state and drives phenomena at that scale.

This state-dependent framework allows a single, unified equation to describe a vast range of phenomena, from the formation of galaxies (S/T state) to the interactions of fundamental particles (T/S and S=T states).

### Dimensionless Parameters and Physical Scaling

Within the computational framework, all parameters (m, g, η, etc.) are treated as dimensionless quantities. This approach simplifies the governing equation and ensures numerical stability across vast scales. To bridge the gap between these dimensionless simulation results and observable reality, a process of physical scaling is used. 

This is achieved by "anchoring" a key emergent property from the simulation (like the mass of a stable soliton or the wavelength of a large-scale structure) to its corresponding, experimentally measured physical value. This anchoring establishes a set of scaling factors, allowing all dimensionless results to be converted into falsifiable predictions with standard physical units (e.g., meters, kilograms, seconds).

This state-dependent and scalable framework allows a single, unified equation to describe a vast range of phenomena, from the formation of galaxies (S/T state) to the interactions of fundamental particles (T/S and S=T states).

This repository is a living body of work that uses LLMs and computational tools to attempt at conducting science.
