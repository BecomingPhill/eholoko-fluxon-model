## About the Ehokolo Fluxon Model

The **Eholoko Fluxon Model (EFM)** represents a paradigm shift in theoretical physics, proposing that all physical phenomena emerge from the interactions of scalar motion as initially proposed by Dewey B. Larson's Reciprocal System Theory. We further posit that the scalar motions are 'self interactions' of an underlying energy field termed the 'Ehokolo Fluxon Field' (φ phi) which organizes into 8 distinct harmonically quantized energy levels or 'densities'.

### Core Principle

The fundamental equation governing the Ehokolo Fluxon Field is the non-linear Klein-Gordon equation:

$$\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \phi + m^2 \phi + g \phi^3 + \eta \phi^5 + \alpha \phi \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} \nabla \phi + \delta \left(\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t}\right)^2 \phi + \gamma \phi - \beta \cos(\omega_n t) \phi = 8\pi G k \phi^2$$

Where:
- **Linear wave terms**: $\frac{\partial^2 \phi}{\partial t^2} - c^2 \nabla^2 \phi$ describe propagation of disturbances
- **Mass term**: $m^2 \phi$ provides confinement for stable soliton structures
- **Non-linear interactions**: $g \phi^3 + \eta \phi^5$ model complex interactions and stability
- **Emergent gravity**: $8\pi G k \phi^2$ replaces spacetime curvature of General Relativity

### Density-Dependent Physics

A core principle of the EFM is that the laws of physics are **density-state-dependent**. The parameters (coupling constants) take on specific values depending on the Harmonic Density State:

- **N1 (S/T)**: Space over Time - Large-scale formation, astrophysics, cosmology
- **N2 (T/S)**: Time over Space - Quantum phenomena, particle physics, mass emergence  
- **N3 (S=T)**: Space equals Time - Electromagnetic forces, atomic structure, biology
