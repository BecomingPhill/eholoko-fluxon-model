# Reciprocal System Theory

This section provides historical context and foundational concepts from Dewey B. Larson's Reciprocal System Theory, which forms the theoretical foundation for the Ehokolo Fluxon Model.

## Historical Background

### Dewey B. Larson (1898-1990)
- **American engineer and physicist**
- **Developed Reciprocal System Theory** as an alternative to conventional physics
- **Published extensively** on his theoretical framework
- **Influenced development** of the Ehokolo Fluxon Model

### Key Publications
- **"The Structure of the Physical Universe"** (1959)
- **"Beyond Newton"** (1964)
- **"The Case Against the Nuclear Atom"** (1963)
- **"Nothing But Motion"** (1979)

## Fundamental Principles

### Scalar Motion
The core concept of Reciprocal System Theory is that all physical phenomena arise from **scalar motion** rather than vector motion:

- **Space and time** are reciprocal aspects of motion
- **Physical entities** are configurations of scalar motion
- **Motion is fundamental** to all physical phenomena

### Reciprocal Relationship
The fundamental relationship in Reciprocal System Theory:

$$x \cdot t = k$$

Where:
- $x$ = space
- $t$ = time  
- $k$ = constant (varies with system)

### Motion vs. Matter
- **Conventional physics**: Matter exists in space and time
- **Reciprocal System**: Matter is motion, space and time are aspects of motion
- **Revolutionary concept**: Motion is the fundamental reality

## Key Concepts

### Space-Time Reciprocity
- **Space and time** are not independent dimensions
- **Reciprocal relationship** between space and time
- **Motion** is the fundamental reality
- **Matter** emerges from motion configurations

### Scalar Motion Types
Larson identified different types of scalar motion:

- **Linear motion**: One-dimensional scalar motion
