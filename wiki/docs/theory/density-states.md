# Density States

This section provides detailed exploration of the 8 harmonic density states that form the foundation of the Ehokolo Fluxon Model.

## Overview

The Ehokolo Fluxon Model proposes that all physical phenomena emerge from 8 distinct harmonic density states, each representing different configurations of the fundamental scalar motion relationship:

$$x \cdot t = k$$

Where $x$ represents space, $t$ represents time, and $k$ is a constant that varies with density state.

## Known Densities

### N1 (S/T) - Space over Time
**Configuration**: Spatial aspects dominate temporal aspects

**Physical Manifestations**:
- Large-scale structure formation
- Cosmological phenomena
- Gravitational interactions
- Astrophysical processes

**Characteristic Scales**:
- Length: Megaparsecs to gigaparsecs
- Time: Millions to billions of years
- Mass: Solar masses to galactic masses

!!! note "Derived Scales"
    These physical scales emerge from dimensionless simulations through the anchoring process described in the [Theory of Mind](theory-of-mind.md). The scales are derived outputs, not inputs to the EFM.

### N2 (T/S) - Time over Space
**Configuration**: Temporal aspects dominate spatial aspects

**Physical Manifestations**:
- Quantum mechanical phenomena
- Particle physics
- Nuclear interactions
- High-energy processes

**Characteristic Scales**:
- Length: Femtometers to picometers
- Time: Femtoseconds to picoseconds
- Mass: Electron masses to proton masses

!!! note "Derived Scales"
    These physical scales emerge from dimensionless simulations through the anchoring process described in the [Theory of Mind](theory-of-mind.md). The scales are derived outputs, not inputs to the EFM.

### N3 (S=T) - Space equals Time
**Configuration**: Spatial and temporal aspects are balanced

**Physical Manifestations**:
- Electromagnetic phenomena
- Atomic structure
- Chemical processes
- Biological systems

**Characteristic Scales**:
- Length: Angstroms to nanometers
- Time: Picoseconds to nanoseconds
- Mass: Atomic masses to molecular masses

!!! note "Derived Scales"
    These physical scales emerge from dimensionless simulations through the anchoring process described in the [Theory of Mind](theory-of-mind.md). The scales are derived outputs, not inputs to the EFM.

## Future Densities

### N4-N8 - Unexplored Densities
**Status**: Currently unexplored with no known physical manifestations

**Potential Applications**:
- Extreme energy phenomena
- Unknown physical processes
- Future research directions
- Theoretical extensions

## Density Transitions

### Inter-Density Interactions
The EFM proposes that phenomena can transition between density states:

- **N1 → N2**: Gravitational collapse to quantum scales
- **N2 → N3**: Particle decay to atomic scales
- **N3 → N1**: Atomic processes to cosmological scales

### Transition Mechanisms
- **Energy thresholds**: Specific energy levels trigger transitions
- **Field interactions**: Ehokolo Fluxon Field mediates transitions
- **Soliton dynamics**: Soliton behavior changes with density

## Mathematical Framework

### Density-Dependent Parameters
Each density state has specific parameter values:

```python
# N1 (S/T) parameters
m_n1 = 1.0e-26    # Very small mass parameter
g_n1 = 1.0e-15    # Weak cubic coupling
omega_n1 = 1.0e-18 # Very low frequency

# N2 (T/S) parameters  
m_n2 = 1.0e-15    # Moderate mass parameter
g_n2 = 1.0e-8     # Strong cubic coupling
omega_n2 = 1.0e-12 # High frequency

# N3 (S=T) parameters
m_n3 = 1.0e-6     # Large mass parameter
g_n3 = 1.0e-3     # Very strong cubic coupling
omega_n3 = 1.0e-6  # Very high frequency
```

### State-Dependent Physics
- **Coupling constants**: Vary with density state
- **Physical laws**: Different phenomena emerge at different densities
- **Unified equation**: Single equation describes all scales

## Research Applications

### Density-Specific Research
- **N1 Research**: Cosmology, astrophysics, gravitational physics
- **N2 Research**: Quantum mechanics, particle physics, nuclear physics
- **N3 Research**: Electromagnetic physics, atomic physics, chemistry, biology

### Cross-Density Studies
- **Transition phenomena**: Processes spanning multiple densities
- **Unified descriptions**: Single framework for all scales
- **Emergent properties**: Properties arising from density interactions

## Validation Methods

### Numerical Simulation
